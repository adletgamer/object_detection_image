# Image Object Detection with Python

This repository contains a Python script for performing object detection in images using the MediaPipe and OpenCV (cv2) libraries.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the following dependencies:

1.  **MediaPipe:** The primary library for processing vision models.
2.  **OpenCV (cv2):** Used for image manipulation and visualization.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
├── models/
│   └── ... (Place your MediaPipe model files here)
├── data/
│   └── ... (You can put the images you want to analyze in this folder)
├── object_detection_image.py  # Replace with the name of your main script
└── README.md
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
